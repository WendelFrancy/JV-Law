# Julio Vieira Law Firm 

## A website for a Law Firm, developed to study design and screen variations.

The most difficulty thing that i have created at this project was the `<form>`, because it has a flag, a logo, and differents backgrounds.
Make this real and responsive using only SASS and HTML was pretty hard, but it lead me to learn a lot of cool things about CSS,
like using `::after` to create that beige background and also using box-shadow to make the shadows.
